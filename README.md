# arcade-game-clone
This project consists of a web page in which users can play a version of the arcade classic `Frogger`. The user must navigate their character across the gameboard grid provided without colliding with any of the bugs moving across the screen. When the user reaches the water, the game is won. If a user collides with a bug while trying to cross the sidewalk, they are sent back to the starting position.

The `Frogger` clone game demonstrates, creating and using `classes` with `JavaScript` version `ES6`. It includes various class `instance` methods and `static` methods that allow for the game to function properly. Additionally, various class `properties` are created and used.
